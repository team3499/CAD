The structure of the files and directories should be as follows:

Top Level:
  Designs/        For parts (and assembalys) that were made for a recurring purpose
  Robot/          For parts (and assembalys) that were made for that robot, specifically.
  
Robot/
  YEAR/           This directory should be the year these parts were made/used. If each year becomes too bulky to hold onto
                  in the master branch, branches can be made for each robot.

YEAR/
  robot.txt       There should be a 'breif' description about the years robot, and how it works.



Designs/
  PART            There should be a directory for each part made. If this list becomes to long,
                  then there could be categories for sorting. This is not recommended. Each filename
                  should provide some level of categorical sorting (via alphabetical order).

PART/
  vX/             Version X of the part.
  description.txt
                  There should be a 'breif' description about the part made, and its purpose.
                  Also a description of the version differences is good.

PART/vX/
  alone.png       There could be a picture of the part, not attached to anything.
  in-use.png      There could be a picture of the part in use.
  rendition.png   There could be a cad-rendered image of the part.
